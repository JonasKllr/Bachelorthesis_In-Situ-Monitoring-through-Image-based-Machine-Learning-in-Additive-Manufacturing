# In-situ Monitoring through Image-Based Machine Learning in Additve Manufacturing

## Abstract

Additive Manufacturing is a relatively new technology for manufacturing components.
This technology is increasingly establishing itself alongside conventional manufacturing processes.
Due to complex process parameters, which are effective during the manufacturing process, additive manufacturing is prone to errors.
The goal of this thesis is to automately monitor the printing process of an FDM/FFF 3D printer using a machine learning approach.
For this purpose, camera images and corresponding representations of the CAD geometries will be processed by a machine learning algorithm.
Two different structures of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were tested for this problem by training with different data sets and evaluating them with test prints.
